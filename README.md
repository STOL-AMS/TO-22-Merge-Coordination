# Project Description

This repository contains the source code for implementation of speed harmonization and merge coordination.

Speed Harmonization: Speed harmonization, as a traffic control strategy, adjusts the speed limit of a freeway section based on prevailing traffic conditions.Shockwave detection, speed limit selection, and speed limit broadcasting to upstream vehicles constitute the major components of the speed harmonization strategy. The source code provided here contains all the aformentioned features.

Merge Coordination: Merge coordination aims to minimize the negative impacts of the merging process on the target lane. The shockwave magnitude and duration resulted from a merging maneuver depends on the lane-changing trajectory, traffic conditions in the origin and target lanes, and the response of the vehicles in the target lane to lane-changing vehicle. The source code provided here contains the details of implementing the merge coodination application.
